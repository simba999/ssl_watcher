Thanks for responding so quickly.
This is my first hire on Upwork so I wanted to do something pretty simple initially.
I want to be able to feed a list of domains into a tool, that will:
1) resolve the domain
2) log which IPs it resolves to
3) for each IP that the domain resolves to:
a) check if it listens on 443
b) if it connects, take the info from getpeercert() (https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ssl.html)
c) store it in a Django model in Postgresql (with the times as django times not strings)
d) log any timeouts, resolution fails, unmatched certificates
4) have a basic management interface for internal use only, normal Django admin is probably fine.
5) a basic stats page on how many of the sites that are stored use each certificate chain, histogram of time to expiry and any other useful things you can pull out.
6) have Django tests to show it works for timeouts, bad resolutions, non-SSL/TLS talking 443, parking pages etc.
7) Be as fast as possible as I'll be feeding it a few million domains, although async in django isn't really possible so I'm happy to just divide it up across systems to run rather than make it over complicated.
